Whenever we introduce\\na type of sheaves we will indicate the precise relationship with\\nsimilar notions in the literature.\\nThe goal of this chapter is to state those results\\nthat are either obviously true or straightforward to prove\\nand leave more intricate constructions till later.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nIn fact, it turns out that to develop a fully fledged theory of\\nconstructible \\\\'etale sheaves and/or an adequate discussion of\\nderived categories of complexes $\\\\mathcal{O}$-modules whose\\ncohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent takes a significant amount of work, see\\n\\\\cite{olsson_sheaves}. We will return to this in\\nCohomology of Stacks, Section \\\\ref{stacks-cohomology-section-introduction}.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nIn the literature and in research papers on sheaves on algebraic stacks\\nthe lisse-\\\\'etale site of an algebraic stack often plays a prominent role.\\nHowever, it is a problematic beast, because it turns out that a morphism of\\nalgebraic stacks does not induce a morphism of lisse-\\\\'etale topoi. We have\\ntherefore made the design decision to avoid any mention of the lisse-\\\\'etale\\nsite as long as possible. Arguments that traditionally use the lisse-\\\\'etale\\nsite will be replaced by an argument using a {\\\\v C}ech covering\\nin the site $\\\\mathcal{X}_{smooth}$ defined below.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nSome of the notation, conventions and terminology in this chapter is awkward\\nand may seem backwards to the more experienced reader. This is intentional.\\nPlease see Quot, Section \\\\ref{quot-section-conventions} for an\\nexplanation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Conventions}\\n\\\\label{section-conventions}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nThe conventions we use in this chapter are the same as those in the\\nchapter on algebraic stacks, see\\nAlgebraic Stacks, Section \\\\ref{algebraic-section-conventions}.\\nFor convenience we repeat them here.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nWe work in a suitable big fppf site $\\\\Sch_{fppf}$ as in\\nTopologies, Definition \\\\ref{topologies-definition-big-fppf-site}.\\nSo, if not explicitly stated otherwise all schemes will be objects\\nof $\\\\Sch_{fppf}$. We record what changes if you change the big\\nfppf site elsewhere (insert future reference here).\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nWe will always work relative to a base $S$ contained in $\\\\Sch_{fppf}$.\\nAnd we will then work with the big fppf site $(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$, see\\nTopologies, Definition \\\\ref{topologies-definition-big-small-fppf}.\\nThe absolute case can be recovered by taking\\n$S = \\\\Spec(\\\\mathbf{Z})$.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Presheaves}\\n\\\\label{section-presheaves}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nIn this section we define presheaves on categories fibred in groupoids\\nover $(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$, but most of the discussion works\\nfor categories over any base category. This section also serves to\\nintroduce the notation we will use later on.\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}\\n\\\\label{definition-presheaves}\\nLet $p : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to (\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$ be a category fibred in\\ngroupoids.\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item A {\\\\it presheaf on $\\\\mathcal{X}$} is a presheaf on the\\nunderlying category of $\\\\mathcal{X}$.\\n\\\\item A {\\\\it morphism of presheaves on $\\\\mathcal{X}$} is a morphism of\\npresheaves on the underlying category of $\\\\mathcal{X}$.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nWe denote $\\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{X})$ the category of presheaves on\\n$\\\\mathcal{X}$.\\n\\\\end{definition}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nThis defines presheaves of sets. Of course we can also talk about\\npresheaves of pointed sets, abelian groups, groups, monoids, rings,\\nmodules over a fixed ring, and lie algebras over a fixed field, etc.\\nThe category of {\\\\it abelian presheaves}, i.e., presheaves of abelian\\ngroups, is denoted $\\\\textit{PAb}(\\\\mathcal{X})$.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nLet $f : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y}$ be a $1$-morphism of categories\\nfibred in groupoids over $(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$. Recall that this\\nmeans just that $f$ is a functor over $(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$.\\nThe material in\\nSites, Section \\\\ref{sites-section-more-functoriality-PSh}\\nprovides us with a pair of adjoint functors\\\\footnote{These functors\\nwill be denoted $f^{-1}$ and $f_*$ after\\nLemma \\\\ref{lemma-functoriality-sheaves}\\nhas been proved.}\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{equation-pushforward-pullback}\\nf^p : \\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{Y}) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{X})\\n\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\n{}_pf : \\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{X}) \\\\longrightarrow \\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{Y}).\\n\\\\end{equation}\\nThe adjointness is\\n$$\\n\\\\Mor_{\\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{X})}(f^p\\\\mathcal{G}, \\\\mathcal{F})\\n=\\n\\\\Mor_{\\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{Y})}(\\\\mathcal{G}, {}_pf\\\\mathcal{F})\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{X}))$ and\\n$\\\\mathcal{G} \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\textit{PSh}(\\\\mathcal{Y}))$. We call\\n$f^p\\\\mathcal{G}$ the {\\\\it pullback} of $\\\\mathcal{G}$. It follows\\nfrom the definitions that\\n$$\\nf^p\\\\mathcal{G}(x) = \\\\mathcal{G}(f(x))\\n$$\\nfor any $x \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{X})$. The presheaf ${}_pf\\\\mathcal{F}$\\nis called the {\\\\it pushforward} of $\\\\mathcal{F}$. It is described\\nby the formula\\n$$\\n({}_pf\\\\mathcal{F})(y) = \\\\lim_{f(x) \\\\to y} \\\\mathcal{F}(x).\\n$$\\nThe rest of this section should probably be moved to the chapter\\non sites and in any case should be skipped on a first reading.\\n\\n\\\\begin{lemma}\\n\\\\label{lemma-1-morphisms-presheaves}\\nLet $f : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y}$ and $g : \\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Z}$\\nbe $1$-morphisms of categories fibred in groupoids over\\n$(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$. Then $(g \\\\circ f)^p = f^p \\\\circ g^p$ and\\nthere is a canonical isomorphism\\n${}_p(g \\\\circ f) \\\\to {}_pg \\\\circ {}_pf$\\ncompatible with with adjointness of $(f^p, {}_pf)$, $(g^p, {}_pg)$, and\\n$((g \\\\circ f)^p, {}_p(g \\\\circ f))$.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nLet $\\\\mathcal{H}$ be a presheaf on $\\\\mathcal{Z}$. Then\\n$(g \\\\circ f)^p\\\\mathcal{H} = f^p (g^p\\\\mathcal{H})$ is given\\nby the equalities\\n$$\\n(g \\\\circ f)^p\\\\mathcal{H}(x) = \\\\mathcal{H}((g \\\\circ f)(x))\\n= \\\\mathcal{H}(g(f(x))) = f^p (g^p\\\\mathcal{H})(x).\\n$$\\nWe omit the verification that this is compatible with restriction maps.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nNext, we define the transformation ${}_p(g \\\\circ f) \\\\to {}_pg \\\\circ {}_pf$.\\nLet $\\\\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf on $\\\\mathcal{X}$.\\nIf $z$ is an object of $\\\\mathcal{Z}$ then we get a\\ncategory $\\\\mathcal{J}$ of quadruples\\n$(x, f(x) \\\\to y, y, g(y) \\\\to z)$ and a category $\\\\mathcal{I}$\\nof pairs $(x, g(f(x)) \\\\to z)$.

Let $t : f \\\\to g$\\nbe a $2$-morphism of categories fibred in groupoids over\\n$(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$.

Then\\n$t^p : g^p\\\\mathcal{G} \\\\to f^p\\\\mathcal{G}$ is given by the family\\nof maps\\n$$\\ng^p\\\\mathcal{G}(x) = \\\\mathcal{G}(g(x))\\n\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\mathcal{G}(t_x)}\\n\\\\mathcal{G}(f(x)) = f^p\\\\mathcal{G}(x)\\n$$\\nparametrized by $x \\\\in \\\\Ob(\\\\mathcal{X})$.

If $\\\\mathcal{X}$\\nis an algebraic stack, the literature calls $\\\\mathcal{X}_{fppf}$ (or a\\nsite equivalent to it) the {\\\\it big fppf site} of $\\\\mathcal{X}$ and similarly\\nfor the other ones. We may occasionally use this terminology to\\ndistinguish this construction from others.\\n\\n\\\\begin{remark}\\n\\\\label{remark-ambiguity}\\nWe only use this notation when the symbol $\\\\mathcal{X}$ refers to a\\ncategory fibred in groupoids, and not a scheme, an algebraic space, etc.\\nIn this way we will avoid confusion with the small \\\\'etale site of a\\nscheme, or algebraic space which is denoted $X_\\\\etale$ (in which\\ncase we use a roman capital instead of a calligraphic one).\\n\\\\end{remark}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nNow that we have these topologies defined we can say what it means\\nto have a sheaf on $\\\\mathcal{X}$, i.e., define the corresponding topoi.\\n\\n\\\\begin{definition}\\n\\\\label{definition-sheaves}\\nLet $\\\\mathcal{X}$ be a category fibred in groupoids over\\n$(\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$. Let $\\\\mathcal{F}$ be a presheaf on $\\\\mathcal{X}$.\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item We say $\\\\mathcal{F}$ is a {\\\\it Zariski sheaf}, or a\\n{\\\\it sheaf for the Zariski topology} if $\\\\mathcal{F}$\\nis a sheaf on the associated Zariski site $\\\\mathcal{X}_{Zar}$.\\n\\\\item We say $\\\\mathcal{F}$ is an {\\\\it \\\\'etale sheaf}, or a\\n{\\\\it sheaf for the \\\\'etale topology} if $\\\\mathcal{F}$\\nis a sheaf on the associated \\\\'etale site $\\\\mathcal{X}_\\\\etale$.\\n\\\\item We say $\\\\mathcal{F}$ is a {\\\\it smooth sheaf}, or a\\n{\\\\it sheaf for the smooth topology} if $\\\\mathcal{F}$\\nis a sheaf on the associated smooth site $\\\\mathcal{X}_{smooth}$.\\n\\\\item We say $\\\\mathcal{F}$ is a {\\\\it syntomic sheaf}, or a\\n{\\\\it sheaf for the syntomic topology} if $\\\\mathcal{F}$\\nis a sheaf on the associated syntomic site $\\\\mathcal{X}_{syntomic}$.\\n\\\\item We say $\\\\mathcal{F}$ is an {\\\\it fppf sheaf}, or a {\\\\it sheaf},\\nor a {\\\\it sheaf for the fppf topology} if $\\\\mathcal{F}$\\nis a sheaf on the associated fppf site $\\\\mathcal{X}_{fppf}$.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\nA morphism of sheaves is just a morphism of presheaves. We denote\\nthese categories of sheaves\\n$\\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_{Zar})$,\\n$\\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_\\\\etale)$,\\n$\\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_{smooth})$,\\n$\\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_{syntomic})$, and\\n$\\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_{fppf})$.\\n\\\\end{definition}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nOf course we can also talk about sheaves of pointed sets, abelian groups,\\ngroups, monoids, rings, modules over a fixed ring, and lie algebras over\\na fixed field, etc. The category of {\\\\it abelian sheaves}, i.e., sheaves\\nof abelian groups, is denoted $\\\\textit{Ab}(\\\\mathcal{X}_{fppf})$\\nand similarly for the other topologies. If $\\\\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic\\nstack, then $\\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_{fppf})$ is equivalent (modulo\\nset theoretical problems) to what in the literature would be termed\\nthe {\\\\it category of sheaves on the big fppf site of $\\\\mathcal{X}$}.

Then $\\\\varphi$ is an object\\nof $\\\\mathcal{S}_F$ over $U$. Hence $j(\\\\varphi)$ is an object of\\n$\\\\mathcal{X}$ over $U$. In this way $j$ induces a functor\\n$u : F_\\\\etale \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}$. It is clear that\\n$u$ is continuous and cocontinuous for the \\\\'etale topology on\\n$\\\\mathcal{X}$. Since $j$ is an equivalence, the functor $u$ is fully\\nfaithful. Also, fibre products and equalizers exist in $F_\\\\etale$\\nand $u$ commutes with them because these are computed on the level\\nof underlying schemes in $F_\\\\etale$. Thus\\nSites, Lemmas \\\\ref{sites-lemma-when-shriek},\\n\\\\ref{sites-lemma-preserve-equalizers}, and\\n\\\\ref{sites-lemma-back-and-forth}\\napply. In particular $u$ defines a morphism of topoi\\n$i_F : \\\\Sh(F_\\\\etale) \\\\to \\\\Sh(\\\\mathcal{X}_\\\\etale)$\\nand there exists a left adjoint $i_{F, !}$ of $i_F^{-1}$ which commutes\\nwith fibre products and equalizers.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nWe claim that $i_{F, !}$ is exact. If this is true, then we can define\\n$\\\\pi_F$ by the rules $\\\\pi_F^{-1} = i_{F, !}$ and $\\\\pi_{F, *} = i_F^{-1}$\\nand everything is clear. To prove the claim, note that we already know\\nthat $i_{F, !}$\\nis right exact and preserves fibre products. Hence it suffices to show\\nthat $i_{F, !}* = *$ where $*$ indicates the final object in the category\\nof sheaves of sets.

Namely, if $x : (\\\\Sch/U)_{fppf} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}$ also\\ndenotes the $1$-morphism associated with $x$ and\\n$p : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to (\\\\Sch/S)_{fppf}$ the structure functor,\\nthen we can think of $(y, s_0, \\\\ldots, s_n)$ as\\n$(y, f_0, \\\\ldots, f_n, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n)$\\nwhere $y$ is an object of $\\\\mathcal{X}$, $f_i : p(y) \\\\to p(x)$ is a\\nmorphism of schemes, and $\\\\alpha_i : y \\\\to x(f_i)$ an isomorphism.\\nThe category of $2n+3$-tuples\\n$(y, f_0, \\\\ldots, f_n, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n)$\\nis an incarnation of the $(n + 1)$-fold fibred product $\\\\mathcal{U}_n$\\nof algebraic stacks displayed above, as we discussed in\\nSection \\\\ref{section-cech}.\\nBy Cohomology on Sites, Lemma\\n\\\\ref{sites-cohomology-lemma-cohomology-on-sheaf-sets}\\nwe have\\n$$\\nH^p(\\\\mathcal{U}_n, \\\\mathcal{F}|_{\\\\mathcal{U}_n}) =\\nH^p(\\\\mathcal{X}/h_{x, n}, \\\\mathcal{F}|_{\\\\mathcal{X}/h_{x, n}}) =\\nH^p(h_{x, n}, \\\\mathcal{F}).\\n$$\\nFinally, we discuss the ``primed'' analogue of this. Namely,\\n$\\\\mathcal{X}'/h_{x, n}$ corresponds, via the equivalence above\\nto the full subcategory $\\\\mathcal{U}'_n \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_n$\\nconsisting of those tuples\\n$(y, f_0, \\\\ldots, f_n, \\\\alpha_0, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n)$\\nwith $y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}'$. Hence certainly property (1) of the\\nstatement of the lemma holds\\nfor the inclusion $\\\\mathcal{U}'_n \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_n$.\\nTo see property (2) choose an object $\\\\xi = (y, s_0, \\\\ldots, s_n)$ which\\nlies over a scheme $W$ such that $(\\\\Sch/W)_{fppf} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{U}_n$\\nis smooth and surjective (this is possible as $\\\\mathcal{U}_n$ is\\nan algebraic stack). Then\\n$(\\\\Sch/W)_{fppf} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{U}_n \\\\to (\\\\Sch/U)_{fppf}$\\nis smooth as a composition of base changes of the morphism\\n$x : (\\\\Sch/U)_{fppf} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}$, see\\nAlgebraic Stacks, Lemmas\\n\\\\ref{algebraic-lemma-base-change-representable-transformations-property} and\\n\\\\ref{algebraic-lemma-composition-representable-transformations-property}.\\nThus axiom (1) for $\\\\mathcal{X}$ implies that $y$ is an object of\\n$\\\\mathcal{X}'$ whence $\\\\xi$ is an object of $\\\\mathcal{U}'_n$.\\nUsing again\\n$$\\nH^p(\\\\mathcal{U}'_n, \\\\mathcal{F}|_{\\\\mathcal{U}'_n}) =\\nH^p(\\\\mathcal{X}'/h_{x, n}, \\\\mathcal{F}|_{\\\\mathcal{X}'/h_{x, n}}) =\\nH^p(g^{-1}h_{x, n}, g^{-1}\\\\mathcal{F}).\\n$$\\nwe now can use Case II for \\n$\\\\mathcal{U}'_n \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_n$\\nto conclude.\\n\\\\end{proof}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\input{chapters}\\n\\n\\\\bibliography{my}\\n\\\\bibliographystyle{amsalpha}\\n\\n\\\\end{document}\\n\", [(5839, 5850, 'VAR'), (5857, 5865, 'TYPE'), (6252, 6263, 'VAR'), (6270, 6278, 'TYPE'), (8596, 8607, 'VAR'), (8614, 8622, 'TYPE'), (13009, 13020, 'VAR'), (13027, 13035, 'TYPE'), (14801, 14812, 'VAR'), (14819, 14827, 'TYPE'), (14877, 14888, 'VAR'), (14895, 14903, 'TYPE'), (20463, 20464, 'VAR'), (20471, 20478, 'TYPE'), (24748, 24761, 'VAR'), (24768, 24783, 'TYPE'), (29190, 29201, 'VAR'), (29208, 29216, 'TYPE'), (33845, 33846, 'VAR'), (33853, 33860, 'TYPE'), (33866, 33877, 'VAR'), (33884, 33892, 'TYPE'), (34549, 34550, 'VAR'), (34557, 34564, 'TYPE'), (36248, 36259, 'VAR'), (36266, 36274, 'TYPE'), (37738, 37749, 'VAR'), (37756, 37764, 'TYPE'), (39456, 39467, 'VAR'), (39475, 39482, 'TYPE'), (41553, 41564, 'VAR'), (41571, 41579, 'TYPE'), (41629, 41640, 'VAR'), (41647, 41657, 'TYPE'), (41734, 41735, 'VAR'), (41743, 41749, 'TYPE'), (44132, 44133, 'VAR'), (44140, 44147, 'TYPE'), (44153, 44184, 'VAR'), (44191, 44199, 'TYPE'), (46300, 46301, 'VAR'), (46308, 46314, 'TYPE'), (47907, 47908, 'VAR'), (47915, 47922, 'TYPE'), (49721, 49732, 'VAR'), (49739, 49744, 'TYPE'), (49878, 49885, 'VAR'), (49893, 49899, 'TYPE'), (59964, 59965, 'VAR'), (59973, 59979, 'TYPE'), (60463, 60464, 'VAR'), (60472, 60478, 'TYPE'), (69587, 69588, 'VAR'), (69596, 69602, 'TYPE'), (72250, 72261, 'VAR'), (72268, 72282, 'TYPE'), (76476, 76487, 'VAR'), (76494, 76508, 'TYPE'), (79271, 79282, 'VAR'), (79290, 79299, 'TYPE'), (80960, 80971, 'VAR'), (80979, 80988, 'TYPE'), (82318, 82329, 'VAR'), (82337, 82346, 'TYPE'), (86070, 86071, 'VAR'), (86078, 86084, 'TYPE'), (86094, 86105, 'VAR'), (86112, 86120, 'TYPE'), (87435, 87436, 'VAR'), (87443, 87450, 'TYPE'), (87456, 87467, 'VAR'), (87474, 87482, 'TYPE'), (87592, 87614, 'VAR'), (87622, 87628, 'TYPE'), (92854, 92864, 'VAR'), (92871, 92879, 'TYPE'), (98490, 98491, 'VAR'), (98499, 98505, 'TYPE'), (111827, 111838, 'VAR'), (111846, 111853, 'TYPE'), (112115, 112116, 'VAR'), (112124, 112130, 'TYPE'), (113971, 113972, 'VAR'), (113980, 113986, 'TYPE'), (117562, 117573, 'VAR'), (117581, 117590, 'TYPE'), (127287, 127298, 'VAR'), (127306, 127315, 'TYPE'), (129954, 129965, 'VAR'), (129973, 129980, 'TYPE'), (130257, 130268, 'VAR'), (130276, 130283, 'TYPE'), (135069, 135070, 'VAR'), (135077, 135084, 'TYPE'), (137109, 137110, 'VAR'), (137117, 137124, 'TYPE'), (138746, 138747, 'VAR'), (138754, 138761, 'TYPE'), (138767, 138778, 'VAR'), (138786, 138795, 'TYPE'), (139823, 139824, 'VAR'), (139831, 139838, 'TYPE'), (141186, 141187, 'VAR'), (141194, 141201, 'TYPE'), (142425, 142426, 'VAR'), (142433, 142440, 'TYPE'), (142446, 142457, 'VAR'), (142465, 142474, 'TYPE'), (142496, 142507, 'VAR'), (142514, 142522, 'TYPE'), (143063, 143076, 'VAR'), (143084, 143088, 'TYPE'), (143704, 143705, 'VAR'), (143712, 143719, 'TYPE'), (143725, 143736, 'VAR'), (143744, 143753, 'TYPE'), (143775, 143786, 'VAR'), (143793, 143801, 'TYPE'), (147425, 147426, 'VAR'), (147433, 147440, 'TYPE'), (147446, 147457, 'VAR'), (147465, 147474, 'TYPE')])\n"
