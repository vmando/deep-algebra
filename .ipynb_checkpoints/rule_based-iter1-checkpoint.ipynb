Our tools are Serre's Tor formula\\n(see \\\\cite[Chapter V]{Serre_algebre_locale}), reduction to the diagonal,\\nand the moving lemma.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nWe first recall cycles and how to construct proper pushforward and\\nflat pullback of cycles. Next, we introduce rational equivalence of cycles\\nwhich gives us the Chow groups $A_*(X)$. Proper pushforward and flat pullback\\nfactor through rational equivalence to give operations on Chow groups.\\nThis takes up Sections \\n\\\\ref{section-cycles},\\n\\\\ref{section-cycle-of-closed},\\n\\\\ref{section-cycle-of-coherent-sheaf},\\n\\\\ref{section-pushforward},\\n\\\\ref{section-flat-pullback},\\n\\\\ref{section-rational-equivalence},\\n\\\\ref{section-alternative},\\n\\\\ref{section-pushforward-and-rational-equivalence}, and\\n\\\\ref{section-flat-pullback-and-rational-equivalence}.\\nFor proofs we mostly refer to the chapter on Chow homology\\nwhere these results have been proven in the setting of\\nschemes locally of finite type over a universally catenary Noetherian base, see\\nChow Homology, Section \\\\ref{chow-section-setup} ff.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nSince we work on a nonsingular projective $X$ any irreducible component\\nof the intersection $V \\\\cap W$ of two irreducible closed subvarieties\\nhas dimension at least $\\\\dim(V) + \\\\dim(W) - \\\\dim(X)$. We say $V$ and $W$\\nintersect properly if equality holds for every irreducible component $Z$.\\nIn this case we define the intersection multiplicity\\n$e_Z = e(X, V \\\\cdot W, Z)$ by the formula\\n$$\\ne_Z = \\\\sum\\\\nolimits_i\\n(-1)^i\\n\\\\text{length}_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{X, Z}}\\n\\\\text{Tor}_i^{\\\\mathcal{O}_{X, Z}}(\\\\mathcal{O}_{W, Z}, \\\\mathcal{O}_{V, Z})\\n$$\\nWe need to do a little bit of commutative algebra to show that these\\nintersection multiplicities agree with intuition in simple cases,\\nnamely, that sometimes\\n$$\\ne_Z = \\\\text{length}_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{X, Z}} \\\\mathcal{O}_{V \\\\cap W, Z},\\n$$\\nin other words, only $\\\\text{Tor}_0$ contributes. This happens when\\n$V$ and $W$ are Cohen-Macaulay in the generic point of $Z$ or when\\n$W$ is cut out by a regular sequence in $\\\\mathcal{O}_{X, Z}$ which\\nalso defines a regular sequence on $\\\\mathcal{O}_{V, Z}$. However,\\nExample \\\\ref{example-naive-multiplicity-wrong} shows that higher\\ntors are necessary in general. Moreover, there is a relationship\\nwith the Samuel multiplicity. These matters are discussed in\\nSections\\n\\\\ref{section-intersect-properly},\\n\\\\ref{section-tor-formula},\\n\\\\ref{section-multiplicities},\\n\\\\ref{section-computing-intersection-multiplicities}, and\\n\\\\ref{section-intersection-product}. \\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nReduction to the diagonal is the statement that we can intersect\\n$V$ and $W$ by intersecting $V \\\\times W$ with the diagonal in $X \\\\times X$.\\nThis innocuous statement, which is clear on the level of scheme\\ntheoretic intersections, reduces an intersection of a general pair\\nof closed subschemes, to the case where one of the two is locally cut\\nout by a regular sequence. We use this, following Serre, to obtain positivity\\nof intersection multiplicities. Moreover, reduction to the diagonal\\nleads to additivity of intersection multiplicities, associativity, and a\\nprojection formula. This can be found in Sections\\n\\\\ref{section-exterior-product},\\n\\\\ref{section-reduction-diagonal},\\n\\\\ref{section-associative},\\n\\\\ref{section-flat-pullback-and-intersection-products}, and\\n\\\\ref{section-projection-formula-flat}.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nFinally, we come to the moving lemmas and applications. There are two\\nparts to the moving lemma. The first is that given closed subvarieties\\n$$\\nZ \\\\subset X \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{P}^N\\n$$\\nwith $X$ nonsingular, we can find a subvariety $C \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{P}^N$\\nintersecting $X$ properly such that\\n$$\\nC \\\\cdot X = [Z] + \\\\sum m_j [Z_j]\\n$$\\nand such that the other components $Z_j$ are ``more general'' than $Z$.\\nThe second part is that one can move $C \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{P}^N$ over\\na rational curve to a subvariety in general position with respect to\\nany given list of subvarieties. Combined these results imply that it suffices\\nto define the intersection product of cycles on $X$ which intersect\\nproperly which was done above. Of course this only leads to an intersection\\nproduct on $A_*(X)$ if one can show, as we do in the text, that these products\\npass through rational equivalence. This and some applications are discussed \\nin Sections\\n\\\\ref{section-projection},\\n\\\\ref{section-moving-lemma},\\n\\\\ref{section-intersections-and-rational-equivalence},\\n\\\\ref{section-chow-rings},\\n\\\\ref{section-general-pullback}, and\\n\\\\ref{section-pullback-cycles}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Conventions}\\n\\\\label{section-conventions}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nWe fix an algebraically closed ground field $\\\\mathbf{C}$ of any\\ncharacteristic. All schemes and varieties are over $\\\\mathbf{C}$ and all\\nmorphisms are over $\\\\mathbf{C}$. A variety $X$ is\\n{\\\\it nonsingular} if $X$ is a regular scheme (see\\nProperties, Definition \\\\ref{properties-definition-regular}).\\nIn our case this means that the morphism $X \\\\to \\\\Spec(\\\\mathbf{C})$\\nis smooth (see\\nVarieties, Lemma \\\\ref{varieties-lemma-geometrically-regular-smooth}).\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Cycles}\\n\\\\label{section-cycles}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nLet $X$ be a variety. A {\\\\it closed subvariety} of $X$ is an integral\\nclosed subscheme $Z \\\\subset X$. A {\\\\it $k$-cycle} on $X$ is a finite\\nformal sum $\\\\sum n_i [Z_i]$ where each $Z_i$ is a closed subvariety\\nof dimension $k$. Whenever we use the notation $\\\\alpha = \\\\sum n_i[Z_i]$\\nfor a $k$-cycle we always assume the subvarieties $Z_i$ are pairwise\\ndistinct and $n_i \\\\not = 0$ for all $i$. In this case the\\n{\\\\it support} of $\\\\alpha$ is the closed subset\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Supp}(\\\\alpha) = \\\\bigcup Z_i \\\\subset X\\n$$\\nof dimension $k$.

Let $W \\\\subset X \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1$\\nbe a closed subvariety of dimension $k + 1$. Let $a, b$ be distinct closed\\npoints of $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$. Assume that $X \\\\times a$, $X \\\\times b$ and $W$\\nintersect properly:\\n$$\\n\\\\dim (W \\\\cap X \\\\times a) \\\\leq k,\\\\quad\\n\\\\dim (W \\\\cap X \\\\times b) \\\\leq k.\\n$$\\nThis is true as soon as $W \\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}^1$ is dominant or if $W$ is\\ncontained in a fibre of the projection over a closed point different from\\n$a$ or $b$ (this is an uninteresting case which we will discard). In this\\nsituation the scheme theoretic fibre $W_a$ of the morphism\\n$W \\\\to \\\\mathbf{P}^1$ is equal to the scheme theoretic intersection\\n$W \\\\cap X \\\\times a$ in $X \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1$. Identifying $X \\\\times a$\\nand $X \\\\times b$ with $X$ we may think of the fibres $W_a$ and $W_b$\\nas closed subschemes of $X$ of dimension $\\\\leq k$\\\\footnote{We will sometimes\\nthink of $W_a$ as a closed subscheme of $X \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1$ and sometimes\\nas a closed subscheme of $X$. It should always be clear from context which\\npoint of view is taken.}. A basic example of a\\nrational equivalence is\\n$$\\n[W_a]_k \\\\sim_{rat} [W_b]_k\\n$$\\nThe cycles $[W_a]_k$ and $[W_b]_k$ are easy to compute in practice\\n(given $W$) because they are obtained by proper intersection with\\na Cartier divisor (we will see this in\\nSection \\\\ref{section-intersection-product}).\\nSince the automorphism group of $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$ is $2$-transitive we may\\nmove the pair of closed points $a, b$ to any pair we like. A traditional\\nchoice is to choose $a = 0$ and $b = \\\\infty$.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nMore generally, let $\\\\alpha = \\\\sum n_i [W_i]$ be a $(k + 1)$-cycle on\\n$X \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1$.  Let $a_i, b_i$ be pairs of distinct closed points of\\n$\\\\mathbf{P}^1$. Assume that $X \\\\times a_i$, $X \\\\times b_i$ and $W_i$ intersect\\nproperly, in other words, each $W_i, a_i, b_i$ satisfies the condition\\ndiscussed above. A {\\\\it cycle rationally equivalent to zero} is any cycle\\nof the form\\n$$\\n\\\\sum n_i([W_{i, a_i}]_k - [W_{i, b_i}]_k).\\n$$\\nThis is indeed a $k$-cycle. The collection of $k$-cycles rationally\\nequivalent to zero is an additive subgroup of the group of $k$-cycles.\\nWe say two $k$-cycles are {\\\\it rationally equivalent}, notation\\n$\\\\alpha \\\\sim_{rat} \\\\alpha'$, if $\\\\alpha - \\\\alpha'$ is a cycle rationally\\nequivalent to zero.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nWe define\\n$$\\nA_k(X) = Z_k(X)/ \\\\sim_{rat}\\n$$\\nto be the {\\\\it Chow group of $k$-cycles on $X$}. We will see in\\nLemma \\\\ref{lemma-rational-equivalence}\\nthat this agrees with the Chow group as defined in\\nChow Homology, Definition \\\\ref{chow-definition-rational-equivalence}.\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Rational equivalence and rational functions}\\n\\\\label{section-alternative}\\n\\n\\\\noindent\\nLet $X$ be a variety. Let $W \\\\subset X$ be a subvariety\\nof dimension $k + 1$. Let $f \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}(W)^*$ be a nonzero rational\\nfunction on $W$. For every subvariety $Z \\\\subset W$ of dimension $k$\\none can define the order of vanishing $\\\\text{ord}_{W, Z}(f)$ of $f$ at\\nat $Z$. If $f$ is an element of the local ring $\\\\mathcal{O}_{W, Z}$,\\nthen one has\\n$$\\n\\\\text{ord}_{W, Z}(f) =\\n\\\\text{length}_{\\\\mathcal{O}_{X, z}} \\\\mathcal{O}_{W, Z}/f\\\\mathcal{O}_{W, Z}\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{O}_{X, Z}$, resp.\\\\ $\\\\mathcal{O}_{W, Z}$ is the\\nlocal ring of $X$, resp.\\\\ $W$ at the generic point of $Z$. In general one\\nextends the definition by multiplicativity. The {\\\\it principal divisor\\nassociated to $f$} is\\n$$\\n\\\\text{div}_W(f) = \\\\sum \\\\text{ord}_{W, Z}(f)[Z]\\n$$\\nin $Z_k(W)$. Since $W \\\\subset X$ is a closed subvariety we may think\\nof $\\\\text{div}_W(f)$ as a cycle on $X$.\\nSee Chow Homology, Section \\\\ref{chow-section-principal-divisors}.\\n\\n\\\\begin{lemma}\\n\\\\label{lemma-rational-equivalence}\\nLet $X$ be a variety. Let $W \\\\subset X$ be a subvariety\\nof dimension $k + 1$. Let $f \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}(W)^*$ be a nonzero rational\\nfunction on $W$. Then $\\\\text{div}_W(f)$ is rationally equivalent to zero on\\n$X$. Conversely, these principal divisors generate the abelian group of\\ncycles rationally equivalent to zero on $X$.\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\n\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\nThe first assertion follows from\\nChow Homology, Lemma \\\\ref{chow-lemma-rational-function}.\\nMore precisely, let $W' \\\\subset X \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1$ be the closure\\nof the graph of $f$. Then $\\\\text{div}_W(f) = [W'_0]_k - [W'_\\\\infty]$\\nin $Z_k(W) \\\\subset Z_k(X)$, see part (6) of\\nChow Homology, Lemma \\\\ref{chow-lemma-rational-function}.\\n\\n\\\\medskip\\\\noindent\\nFor the second, let $W' \\\\subset X \\\\times \\\\mathbf{P}^1$ be a closed\\nsubvariety of dimension $k + 1$ which dominates $\\\\mathbf{P}^1$.\\nWe will show that $[W'_0]_k - [W'_\\\\infty]_k$ is a principal divisor\\nwhich will finish the proof. Let $W \\\\subset X$ be the image of $W'$\\nunder the projection to $X$. Then $W' \\\\to W$ is proper and generically\\nfinite\\\\footnote{If $W' \\\\to W$ is birational, then the result follows\\nfrom Chow Homology, Lemma \\\\ref{chow-lemma-rational-function}.\\nOur task is to show that even if $W' \\\\to W$\\nhas degree $>1$ the basic rational equivalence\\n$[W'_0]_k \\\\sim_{rat} [W'_\\\\infty]_k$ comes from a principal divisor\\non a subvariety of $X$.}.
